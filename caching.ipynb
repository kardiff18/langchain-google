      "content='The provided text is a research paper titled \"Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context\" by the Gemini Team at Google. The paper discusses the capabilities and evaluations of Gemini 1.5 Pro, a highly compute-efficient multimodal model that excels in handling long contexts across different modalities like text, video, and audio.\\n\\nHere\\'s a summary of the key points:\\n\\n**Gemini 1.5 Pro\\'s Capabilities:**\\n\\n* **Extended context window:** Can handle up to 10 million tokens, allowing it to process long documents, hours of video and audio, and even entire codebases. This is a significant improvement over previous models like Claude 2.1 (200k tokens) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k tokens).\\n* **Multimodal understanding:** Can seamlessly integrate text, images, video, and audio within the same input sequence, enabling diverse and complex interactions.\\n* **Efficient and high-quality:** Achieves comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra while requiring less training compute and being more efficient to serve.\\n* **In-context learning:** Demonstrates remarkable in-context learning abilities, showcased by its ability to learn to translate English to Kalamang, a low-resource language, based solely on provided linguistic resources.\\n\\n**Evaluations:**\\n\\n* **Diagnostic evaluations:** Showed near-perfect recall in needle-in-haystack tasks for all modalities, demonstrating the model\\'s ability to recall specific information within massive amounts of context.\\n* **Realistic long-context evaluations:** Showed impressive performance in tasks like long-document QA, long-context audio transcription, and long-context video QA, highlighting the practical applicability of the extended context window.\\n* **Core capability evaluations:** Maintained high performance on core text tasks like math, science, reasoning, coding, multilinguality, and instruction following, comparable to Gemini 1.0 Pro and Ultra. Similar performance was seen in image and video understanding tasks.\\n\\n**Responsible Deployment:**\\n\\n* **Impact Assessment:** Analyzed societal benefits and risks associated with the model\\'s capabilities.\\n* **Safety Mitigations:** Implemented supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback to address adversarial queries.\\n* **Safety Evaluations:** Conducted evaluations across content safety, representational harms, memorization, and dangerous capabilities.\\n* **Deployment Controls:** Released external model cards and implemented safety filters and other safeguards for products using the model.\\n\\n**Discussion:**\\n\\nThe paper highlights the importance of creating more challenging and robust evaluations that stress-test the model\\'s capabilities in complex long-context scenarios.  The authors acknowledge the need for continued research in mitigating hallucinations and improving reasoning abilities, despite the model\\'s current impressive performance.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nThe research paper presents Gemini 1.5 Pro as a significant advancement in multimodal AI, pushing the boundaries of long-context understanding while maintaining high-quality performance in core capabilities. The paper emphasizes the need for responsible development and deployment of such powerful models to maximize their societal benefit while mitigating potential harms. \\n' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'is_blocked': False, 'safety_ratings': [{'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH', 'probability_label': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False, 'severity': 'HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE'}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT', 'probability_label': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False, 'severity': 'HARM_SEVERITY_LOW'}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT', 'probability_label': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False, 'severity': 'HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE'}, {'category': 'HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT', 'probability_label': 'NEGLIGIBLE', 'blocked': False, 'severity': 'HARM_SEVERITY_LOW'}], 'usage_metadata': {'prompt_token_count': 43092, 'candidates_token_count': 632, 'total_token_count': 43724, 'cached_content_token_count': 0}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'avg_logprobs': -0.5553025354312945} id='run-4ac3a608-8ede-4ee6-82a1-8b2154e29235-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 43092, 'output_tokens': 632, 'total_tokens': 43724}\n",
